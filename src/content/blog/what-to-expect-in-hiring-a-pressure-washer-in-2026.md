## What To Expect in Hiring a Pressure Washer in 255

So you've decided to hire a professional pressure washing contractor to clean your home's exterior. Great choice! But if this is your first time hiring a pressure washing service, you might be wondering what happens next. Based on current industry standards and best practices in 2026, here's everything you should expect throughout the entire process.

## Before the Appointment: Initial Contact and Assessment

## The Free Estimate Process

Most reputable pressure washing companies will offer you a free estimate. Here's what typically happens during this phase:

### The Initial Call or Online Booking

When you first reach out, expect the company to ask you questions about your property, such as the size of your home, what surfaces need cleaning (siding, roof, driveway, deck), and any specific concerns you have like stubborn stains or algae growth. Modern companies in 2026 often use GPS fleet tracking, so they can give you accurate arrival windows for the estimate.

## The On-Site Assessment

A professional contractor will visit your property to evaluate the job. During this visit, they should:

* Walk around your entire property to assess all surfaces
* Identify your home's materials (vinyl siding, stucco, brick, painted wood, etc.)
* Note the level of buildup, mold, mildew, or algae present
* Check your landscaping to plan protection strategies
* Discuss your specific goals and concerns
* Explain whether softwashing or traditional pressure washing is best for your surfaces
